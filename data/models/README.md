# Local Models (Not Committed)

This directory is intentionally excluded from git because model weights are large
and often license-restricted.

Download models with:
- `ai-eng/util/prefetch_models.py`

Expected layout:
- `data/models/local/<tier>/<model-name>/`

Example tiers: `tiny`, `small`, `fast`, `performance`, `reasoning`, `full`.
