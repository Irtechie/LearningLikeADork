{"instruction": "Summarize the key details of Builds.", "input": "", "output": "# Builds\n\nBasic Builds:\n[\n]\nThere are seven basic builds in my opinion, and they serve as a foundation which all builds are constructed from.\nTANK: A tank is modelled to take as many hits as possible, entirely focused on defensive bonuses/modifiers and has a stat distribution of 1\n/30\n/1\n(Meat Shield) to 1\n/4\n/1\n(a useful damage dealer, can heal itself reasonably well but less tanky). It takes more work to be a tank, as a tank must have very good defensive procs to be viable.\nOFF-TANK: An off-tank is modelled to take hits for the team but also be a valuable damage dealer. Using mostly defensive procs, and sometimes a few offensive ones, an off-tank is much more popular than a tank at higher levels. It has been proven that as a tank, the sheer amount of health from a full tank is not needed, so, similarly to a bait, the spare TS goes into power. Speed is not recommended with this build. An off-tank's stat distribution is almost always the same, being 5/5/1 or 6/5/1\nBAIT: A bait is modelled to be a low health tank, able to take 'target weakest' attacks but still able to survive onslaughts of attacks. A bait is the hardest build to achieve, requiring rock solid procs to be effective and must be well-planned, ensuring that its stamina does not fall above the team's DPS or healer. A bait can have offensive procs as well as defensive ones, to maximise the effectiveness of the bait's enormous DPS potential. A Bait can have any stat distribution as long as it's stamina stays the lowe"}

Runes only effect the player that has them equipped.\nRunes are not 'dropped', but may be obtained through crafting or as prizes in events such as PvP and Trials. Runes are crafted using Rune Fragments (\n), Gold, and other materials. Crafting will provide a random rune of the type being created for all runes below Myth status.\nInserted runes can be destroyed for materials by using the 'Melt' button. Only inactive runes can be melted. When melted, runes return 20% of their rune fragment crafting cost.\nFor example, a legendary Minor/Major rune will return 100 rune fragments when melted.\nRune Fragments\n[\n]\nRune fragments\nare materials used to create runes.
